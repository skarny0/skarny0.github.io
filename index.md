### Updates as of 4/07/25

I'm currently/still a researcher at the University of California, Irvine advised by Prof. Mark Steyvers working on problems related to Human-AI collaboration! Prior to this, I graduated with honors from the University of California, Berkeley, earning a B.A. in Cognitive Science with a minor in Data Science.

My present work explores how social cognitive mechanisms such as theory of mind (ToM), knowing and reasoning about other's minds/mental states, may improve human-AI collaboration. My work takes on an interdisciplinary flavor, blending cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. 

<!-- I also enjoy thinking/imagining/designing technology that seeks to utilize mental inference (i.e. mind reading) to create tools that improve human well-being. -->
