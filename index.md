### As of 07/23/2025

I'm moving to Boston to start graduate school at the MIT Media Lab and will be advised by Dr. Pat Pataranutaporn. I'll be a contributor to his initiative, Advancing Humans with AI (AHA), [here](https://aha.media.mit.edu/).

I'm also completing my work as a researcher at UCI over the next few weeks. Will have some exciting updates about my final project in the lab soon!

<!-- Prior to this, I graduated with honors from the University of California, Berkeley, earning a B.A. in Cognitive Science with a minor in Data Science. -->

My present work explores how social cognitive mechanisms such as theory of mind (ToM), knowing and reasoning about other's minds/mental states, may improve human-AI collaboration. My work takes on an interdisciplinary flavor, blending cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. 

<!-- I also enjoy thinking/imagining/designing technology that seeks to utilize mental inference (i.e. mind reading) to create tools that improve human well-being. -->
