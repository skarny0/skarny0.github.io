## __Task building for Human-AI Exploration__

### __Single-player AI assistance__
Built a real-time AI assistant that helps players learn a dynamic decision making task. It is an approximation to a traveling salesman problem with moving destinations. Work related to this was published at the ACM Collective Intelligence Conference.

*Player must execute interceptions with and without AI assistance.*

### __Multiplayer Collaboration__
We built a dynamic decision-making task where the goal is to intercept as many moving, point-valued targets as possible. 

Initially designed as an AI assistance paradigm for a previous paper, it was refitted to be a two-player collaboration task.

We designed a collaborative agent using principles from the literature to see which design characteristics are best suited for human collaboration. 

Current manuscript is under development!

Also using variations of this paradigm to explore explanatory AI (XAI) as well multiplayer human collaboration.

*A Human (red avatar) work alongside an AI collaborator (green avatar) to get as many points as possible. Current manuscript designs agents with varying levels of consdieration for the human player to discover the subjective, non-perforamnce driven, traits of AI agents that make them good collaborators.*

## __Personal Projects__

### __UsedSurf BoardSearch__

Built a [search engine](https://usedsurf.com/board-search-program/) for the worlds largest used surfboard shop, UsedSurf, that allows surfers to find boards accross varying levels of specificty and be notified, via email, whenever there is inventory that matches their search.
