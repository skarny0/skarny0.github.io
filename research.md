# research

My research focuses on developing AI agents capable of effective collaboration in dynamic environments. Here are some of my current research areas:

## collaborative agents
Investigating methods to create ai systems that can work alongside humans in dynamic task settings.

## adaptive decision-making
Developing algorithms that allow ai agents to make robust decisions in uncertain and rapidly changing environments.

## theory of mind 
Buildling out better models of human cognition to understand people's underlying goals and preferences.
