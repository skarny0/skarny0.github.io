## __My present work focuses on:__
* Investigating how to create AI systems that work alongside humans in real-world task settings.
* Developing algorithms that allow AI agents to make robust decisions in uncertain and rapidly changing environments.
* Buildling out better models of human cognition to understand people's underlying goals and preferences.
